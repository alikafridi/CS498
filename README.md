This is the code developed by Ali Afridi for the CS 498 Undergraduate Research Project. 

The files of importance are AnalyzeData.java, GenerateData.java, and VisualizeData.java.
	- AnalyzeData will look for periodic motion in a file that is provided
		Currently doesn't do anything
	- GenerateData will create an excel spreadsheet with sample data based on user preferences
		Currently just creates a spreadsheet with circular periodic motion over 4 days
		Will add features to take user preferences into account. Also will add other types of motion
	- VisualizeData will create a visual way to explore the spatio-temporal data-sets. 
		Currently doesn't do anything useful

This code currently only works for the spatio-temporal data that has been collected in the data sets. This will soon be updated to work with other spatio-temporal data-sets.

NOTE: JCanvas and JXL were NOT written by Ali.
